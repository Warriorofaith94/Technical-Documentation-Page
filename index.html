            <p>You can’t just pick out a color and start slapping paint on the walls.
                    You need to prep your room and your walls first.
                    You’ll want to wipe down the walls and baseboards.
                    I just use a damp rag for the baseboards and a dusting mitt or Swiffer cloth for the walls. Scrub off any thing sticky on the walls, too.</p>

            <p>I also patch any nail holes that are left in the walls that I’m not going to reuse.
                If I’m just going to hang a piece of art back up, I don’t bother patching it, but otherwise it gets patched with spackling.
                I love this stuff. I use a small speckling knife to apply it to the walls. But sometimes just my finger will do in a pinch..</p>

             <p> I just use my frog tape on the baseboards around the room. I find that this helps protect the baseboards and flooring
                 if any paint happens to run down the walls, or if the roller splatters paint at all.

            <p> You’ll want to roll the wall using different angles, roll to the right and roll to the left, to make sure to get a nice even coverage.
            When you dip your roller in the paint,  use the part of the tray that’s textured to roll the excess off.
            You want the roller to be loaded with paint, but not dripping.
            As you paint, be sure to notice that the coverage is even and that you’re not leaving drip marks behind.
            Roll lightly over drip marks to smooth them out. </p>

              <p> I don’t tape the door or window frames or ceiling, because I use an angled brush and I cut in the edge of the walls.
                  It takes a little bit of patience and a steady hand, but I find that this method works better for me than taping and painting sloppily along the wall.
                  It also saves a lot of time and you don’t need any fancy tools, methods or equipment.
                  I found this fabulous tutorial for cutting in a room at PB&J Stories.</p>
